##VersionOne.CorsProxy

In the past if you wanted to use [https://github.com/versionone/VersionOne.Requestor.NET](https://github.com/versionone/VersionOne.Requestor.NET "VersionOne.Requestor.NET") you were forced to enable CORS in your VersionOne IIS server. That is no longer the case since now you can easily use a proxy when enabling CORS is not an option.

##Deploy
If you want to quickly deploy without needing to host the proxy yourself you just need to click the next button.

You only need to create a free heroku account if you don't already have one.
